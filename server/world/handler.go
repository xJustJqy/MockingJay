	// called, both the position of the original fire will be passed, and the position where it will spread to after the

	// wood, that can be broken by fire. HandleBlockBurn is often succeeded by HandleFireSpread, when fire spreads to
	// the position of the original block and the event.Context is not cancelled in HandleBlockBurn.
